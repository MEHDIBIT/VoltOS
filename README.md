# VoltOS
VoltOS is a 32-bit OS built from scratch in C &amp; x86 Assembly to explore low-level systems. It features a custom GDT, a robust IDT for stable interrupt handling, and drivers for core hardware (VGA, PIT, Keyboard). The primary interface is an interactive shell with commands for system control. Built with standard tools and runs on QEMU.
